## Choose Project

## Define MVP

- [ ] Create a simple, concise statement of what your application will achieve and the value it has to its users.  Every function and feature in the application should reinforce this goal.
- [ ] List the functions you want to include in the application. Prioritize them by identifying which are needs and which are wants.
- [ ] List the features in each function and prioritize them in the same manner. Identify which are needs and which are wants.
- [ ] Define the attributes and roles of your end users and match them to your features and functions. This helps ensure that the app will have a logical flow, and more importantly, that it meets all user needs.
- [ ] Add tasks needed to reach MVP status to your project backlog. Since you'll be following Agile principles, the backlog won't be complete until the latter part of the project. The team will continuously revise it in each sprint.
- [ ] Additional MVP Criteria:
- Pleasant user experience
- Clean and pleasant UI / layout
- Handling of edge cases so your app doesn't crash when users use it
- Deployed to a website
- Responsive so users can see it on mobile and web
